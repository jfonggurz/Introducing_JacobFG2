  	<p> Hello, my name is Jacob Fong-Gurzinsky. I am a first-year student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of
    Journalism. I want to concentrate in Health and Sciences Reporting. I grew up in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington. </p>

    <p> <strong> Here are my 3 favorite journalism articles: </strong> </p>

    <ol class="news">
        <li> You're Swabbing a Dead Gorilla for Ebola. Then It Gets Worse -<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/health/ebola-gorillas.html"
        target="blank">The New York Times</a>. I like that this article describes the work that the scientists are doing and how unusual/dangerous it is. </li>
        <li> New TB Vaccine Could Save Millions of Lives, Study Suggests -<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/health/tuberculosis-vaccine.html"
        target="blank">The New York Times</a>. Since the article notes that tuberculosis is so dangerous, this was hopeful news. </li>
        <li> In Every Tree, a Trillion Tiny Lives -<a 
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/biology-trees-microbiomes.html"
        target="blank">The New York Times</a>. I am interested in microbiomes and I think it is fascinating what we we are learning about them. </li>
    </ol>
